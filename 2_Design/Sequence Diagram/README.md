# SEQUENCE DIAGRAM
* A sequence diagram or system sequence diagram (SSD) shows object interactions arranged in time sequence in the field of software engineering. It depicts the objects involved in the scenario and the sequence of messages exchanged between the objects needed to carry out the functionality of scenario.
* A sequence diagram is structured in such a way that it represents a timeline which begins at the top and descends gradually to mark the sequence of interactions. Each object has a column and the messages exchanged between them are represented by arrows.
